# kmweb

Web UI for [kmrs](https://github.com/kmworks/kmrs), the Komga-compatible media
server rewritten in Rust.

Built with React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, TanStack Query and Zustand.
The design language follows [KMReader](https://github.com/kmworks/kmreader):
dark-first themes, a warm orange accent, √2 covers, serif section titles and
blurred-cover resume cards.

## Features

- Dashboard with configurable library scope: Keep Reading, On Deck, Recently
  Released/Added Books, Recently Added/Updated Series, Recently Read
- Browse series, books, collections and read lists with facet filters
  (read status, genres, tags, publishers, authors, age rating, language,
  release years), sort options and infinite scroll
- Series and book detail pages with metadata, progress and quick actions
- Full-text search across series, books, collections and read lists
- Comic reader: single/double page spreads (with cover handling), LTR/RTL,
  vertical and webtoon modes, fit/original scaling, keyboard shortcuts, swipe,
  thumbnail explorer, per-series direction override, read-progress sync and
  continuous reading across books (read-list context aware)
- Account page: password change, API keys, appearance (theme, card style,
  grid density, spoiler blur) and reader defaults
- Live updates over SSE (lists refresh and covers reload when the server
  changes them)

## Develop

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev           # http://localhost:5173, proxies /api /sse /actuator to localhost:25600
pnpm lint
pnpm build         # type-check + production bundle in dist/
```

Point `webui.dir` (env `KOMGA_WEBUI_DIR`) at the `dist/` folder to have kmrs
serve the UI at `/` with SPA fallback.

## Reader shortcuts

Arrows turn pages (mirrored in RTL, vertical in vertical mode), `Home`/`End`
first/last page, `L`/`R`/`V`/`W` reading direction, `C` scale, `D` page
layout, `F` fullscreen, `M` menu, `S` settings, `T` thumbnails, `H` help,
`Esc` close/back. Webtoon: `Space`/`PageUp`/`PageDown` scroll, `P` side
padding, `N` page gap.

## Legacy

Releases tagged `komga-webui/v<upstream-version>` carry prebuilt
[komga-webui](https://github.com/gotson/komga) `npm run build` output as
`komga-webui-v<upstream-version>.tar.gz` assets.
